To Do

Fix drawing of the player's strength when it increases.
Handle the case where the two pieces are destroyed in quick succession,
leaving an explosion sprite plotted for the first piece.
Add a screen to show between levels.
Add sounds.
Nice to have: make projectiles start next to the player, not on top of him.

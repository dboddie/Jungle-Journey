To Do

Check and fix object generation.
Implement high score input.
Improve the fire, explosion and player sprites.
Add sounds.
Nice to have: make projectiles start next to the player, not on top of him.
Nice to have: make one of the enemies have different movement.
Nice to have: make the boomerang turn before hitting a wall.

Things to look out for

Score text disappearing - probably caused by incorrect colour setting
between levels.
Strength level increasing unexpectedly.

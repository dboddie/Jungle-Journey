To Do

Add last two enemy sprite sets.
Include the source in the disk image, avoiding potential license issues with
redistribution.
Change the filing system to tape (*TAPE) to avoid potential problems with high
PAGE systems.

Things to look out for

A high score not causing the high score screen to be activated.
Ensure that each scenery explosion finishes before the next starts.

To Do

Optimise routines, particularly enemy generation and plotting.
    Test the extent to which the unplot/plot buffer is filled.
    consider making some enemies pause, or add different movement behaviour for
    some of them.
Move at least one secret item on the final level and introduce room scenery
in the final room.
Improve the fire, explosion and player sprites.
Add sounds.
Nice to have: analogue joystick support.
Nice to have: make one of the enemies have different movement.
Nice to have: make the boomerang turn before hitting a wall.
Nice to have: make projectiles start next to the player, not on top of him.

Things to look out for

Strength level increasing unexpectedly.
A high score not causing the high score screen to be activated.
Flickering and jerky player motion at the top of the screen.

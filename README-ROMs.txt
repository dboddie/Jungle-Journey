Jungle Journey

The last flames of the campfire fade to glowing embers and I am alone.
My recent acquaintances, their packs and paraphernalia have gone, leaving
me stranded deep in the heart of this jungle realm. Clouds momentarily
sweep the cold face of the moon and I perceive the clicks, whistles and
cries of creatures in the hot air that cloaks this place. Desperately, I
try to stay my panic and remember those fragments of wilderness craft
learned and unlearned many years ago.

    Choose your weapon carefully,
    Get ready for a fight.
    The jungle can be dangerous
    If you go there at night.
    There's time to pick up treasure,
    But no time to stop and stare.
    If you don't find the hidden cave
    You won't get out of there.

Hopeless, I scramble to my feet, reaching for any weapon still left to me.
Struggling through the dense undergrowth, I search for signs of a track or
trail. At first glance, paths that seemed to lead to safety turn out to be
impassable, overgrown by tangled and twisted vines. I remember the words of
an old teacher:

 "Do not be tempted to use fire to make your way.
  Many a traveller has strayed from the path, using fire to blaze a trail,
  only to reach a dead end. Trying to return, they find that the jungle
  has grown back. Those who are desperate enough will even seek out
  forgotten routes when the way home is in sight."

Sensing my presence, obscene creatures emerge from the darkness, hungry
for prey. Only through skill and luck am I able to dispatch them back
into the shadows. Even though I know I must journey deeper into this
uncharted land to find the way home, the thought of vengeance drives me on.

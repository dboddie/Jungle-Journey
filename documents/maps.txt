Notes on map generation
=======================

The game allows the player to reach a "bonus" level 5 by exiting level 4 via a
door rather than through the cave entrance. The possibility of this was
intentionally included in the game. I could have ensured that level 4 didn't
include a key or a door, but instead ensured that they were placed in parts of
the level that the player could never reach - unless they had picked up the
fireball weapon and started to break into otherwise closed off areas of the
map.

Level 5 is just another level that happens to use the data that follows each
array. So its seed will be 5 from the byte after 144 which happens to be the
first element in the start_rooms_x array, the start room will be at (5, 7),
exit at (0, 1) and the key at (0, 1).

seeds:         .byte 100, 239, 183, 144
start_rooms_x: .byte 5,   3,   5,   10
start_rooms_y: .byte 5,   8,   1,   8
exit_rooms_x:  .byte 7,   9,   3,   0
exit_rooms_y:  .byte 0,   0,   9,   10
key_rooms_x:   .byte 1,   5,  10,   1
key_rooms_y:   .byte 0,   2,   6,   4
key_rooms:     .byte 1,  27,  76,  45

Unfortunately, the clash between the key and door rooms means that only the
door will appear on the level and progress to any following levels is
impossible. I had hoped that the player might get to experience a few "bonus"
levels, though I should be grateful that the one that can be accessed at least
allows the player to reach the cave entrance. I included this on level 4
onwards to ensure that completion of the game was at least theoretically
possible.

The room at (0, 5) on level 5 is odd because it looks like it should contain a
key or a door, or perhaps should have been the start room. It is missing
scenery as a result of a quirk in the way the pseudo-random number generator
works. The generator uses two starting values: j and (seed - i), where j is the
column of the room in the map and i is the row. When the seed is 5 then the
values are

    first = j
    second = 5 - i

which means that, in room (0, 5), the values will both be zero. This results in
a stream of zeros from the generator, hence an empty room. Normally this would
be something I would want to eliminate, which is why the seeds for the first
four levels are high values, but in this case it adds a little mystery to the
proceedings. Players might wonder if the key should have been in the room but
was replaced by some other item!
